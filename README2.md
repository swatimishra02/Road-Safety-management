# AI/ML Hackathon on Road Safety

## Overview

This project leverages AI/ML technologies, including computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning, to optimize traffic flow and enhance road safety by analyzing real-time traffic camera footage. It aims to provide advanced notifications about traffic conditions and hazards, empowering informed decision-making and accident prevention.

## Objectives

- **Optimize Traffic Flow:** Analyze traffic camera footage in real-time to improve traffic management and safety.
- **Enhance Road Safety:** Provide timely notifications about hazards like potholes for accident prevention.

## Key Features

- **People Counting:** Employ computer vision to count pedestrians, optimizing pedestrian crossing times.
- **Pothole Detection:** Use image segmentation to identify road defects for timely maintenance.
- **Traffic Light Detection:** Detect traffic lights and their current signals (red/yellow/green) to inform drivers.
- **Vehicle Speed Detection:** Estimate vehicle speeds to identify and mitigate traffic congestion.
- **Lane-Specific Vehicle Counting:** Differentiate vehicles by lane to manage traffic flow at bottlenecks.
- **Lane-Wise Vehicle Tracking:** Track vehicles by lane for wrong-way vehicle detection, traffic counting, vehicle type identification, and overcrowding prevention.

## Implementation

The system processes video feeds from traffic cameras continuously, ensuring traffic information is always current and accurate. By applying sophisticated AI/ML algorithms, the project demonstrates the potential of technology to significantly improve traffic flow and road safety.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the impactful application of AI and ML in traffic management and road safety. Through advanced data analysis and real-time monitoring, it aims to make roads safer and improve traffic flow, showcasing the power of technology in solving real-world problems.
