# AI/ML Hackathon on Road Safety

## Problem Statement
**Enhancing Road Safety with AI/ML for Traffic Flow Optimization.**

## Objective
Optimizing traffic flow using computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning to analyze traffic camera footage and provide real-time traffic condition suggestions.

## Description
The project aims to enhance traffic management by offering advanced notifications about traffic conditions and hazards like potholes, empowering informed decision-making for accident avoidance. Key features include:

1. **People Counting:** Utilizing computer vision algorithms to count pedestrians, aiding in optimizing pedestrian crossings.
2. **Pothole Detection:** Identifying road defects through image segmentation for preventive maintenance.
3. **Traffic Light Detection:** Detects traffic lights and the signal shown(red/yellow/green) displayed by it.
4. **Vehicle Speed Detection:** Estimating vehicle speeds to identify traffic congestion points, aiding in traffic light signal adjustments or diversions.
5. **Lane-Specific Vehicle Counting:** Differentiating vehicles in lanes to manage flow at bottlenecks or adjust lane usage dynamically.
6. **Lane-Wise Vehicle Tracking:** This feature flags wrong-way vehicles, counts traffic, detects vehicle types, prevents overcrowding.

## Real-time Analysis
The system continuously processes video feeds from traffic cameras, providing up-to-date traffic information.

This approach demonstrates the application of AI and machine learning in improving traffic flow and road safety through advanced data analysis and real-time monitoring.
